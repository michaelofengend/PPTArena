\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We introduce PPTArena and PPTPilot to make PowerPoint editing a concrete, measurable capability for agentic multimodal systems. PPTArena turns real slide decks, human-authored edit programs and ground truths, and style-aware rubrics into a benchmark that highlights instruction fidelity, structural grounding, and layout quality beyond generation-centric evaluations. PPTPilot shows that a dual-path paradigm with explicit plan-edit-verify loops substantially improves reliability, outperforming strong proprietary agents and frontier VLMs. Yet agents still fail on complex, long-horizon, multi-modal tasks indicating that robust PPT editing remains far from solved. We hope PPTArena and PPTPilot serve as a foundation for future work on stronger PPT editing systems that can safely and reliably operate on the documents people actually use.
