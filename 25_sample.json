A new, relevant title must be created based on its content (e.g., \"Rootmotion vs. controlled movement\") and placed in the title placeholder.\n- **Visual Composition:**\n    - Images on the modified slides must be repositioned to create a visually clean and balanced layout.\n    - There must be no overlap between text and images, or between different images.\n    - All content must be legible and contained within the slide boundaries.",

Arrange the four animal photos into a dynamic, asymmetrical collage: a long cheetah strip across the upper left, a tall tiger close-up forming a right-hand column, the lion portrait in the lower left, and the kitten photo in the lower right. Separate the photos with clean white gaps so that they never touch and a strong diagonal division is visible across the slide. Use a solid white slide background.\n\nOn slide 2, convert the landscape and texture photos into a gallery-style board. Use a solid dark (charcoal) slide background and add a large centered frame made from one or two nested white-outline rectangles, leaving an even margin to the slide edges. Inside this frame, place the four landscape/texture photos (pebbles, raked sand with spheres, dunes, canyon) in a neat 2×2 grid. Each photo should sit inside a dark card with a thin white outline around it, with even spacing between cards and from the frame edges to create a balanced gallery layout.",
    "style_target": "**Slide 1 modifications (animal ensemble mosaic):**\n- Change the slide background to SOLID(1) white instead of a picture or patterned background.\n- Remove any sand/texture pictures and stray black rectangles that previously sat behind the animals.\n- The final slide must contain exactly four animal photos: \n  • a cheetah running on a black background,\n  • a close-up tiger face,\n  • a lion portrait,\n  • a kitten chasing a butterfly.\n- Reposition and resize the animal photos to create a dynamic collage:\n  • The cheetah image forms a wide, horizontal strip along the top-left portion of the slide, touching the left edge and extending most of the way across the slide.\n  • The tiger close-up forms a tall vertical panel on the right, aligned to the right edge and spanning from near the top of the slide down toward the bottom.\n  • The lion portrait occupies the lower-left quadrant beneath the cheetah, aligned to the left edge.\n  • The kitten photo sits in the lower-right area beneath the tiger panel, filling the remaining bottom-right space.\n- Ensure there are clean white gaps between all four photos so they do not touch or overlap. The composition should create a strong diagonal division (a white band/gap) from the top-left toward the bottom-right of the slide.\n- All photos must be fully within the slide boundaries.\n\n**Slide 2 modifications (landscape gallery board):**\n- Change the slide background to SOLID(1) with a dark charcoal color.\n- Add a large centered rectangular frame made from one or two nested rectangles that only have a white outline (no fill), leaving an even margin from the slide edges. This double-outline effect should visually separate the gallery from the background.\n- Inside this framed area, create a 2×2 grid of four \"gallery cards\" for the photos:\n  • Each card is a dark rectangle with a thin white outline that serves as the photo mat.\n  • The cards must be evenly spaced horizontally and vertically, with consistent gaps between them and from the inner frame edges.\n- Place each of the four landscape/texture photos inside its own card:\n  • Pebbles/rocks photo (top-left card)\n  • Raked sand with three spheres (top-right card)\n  • Sand dunes (bottom-left card)\n  • Canyon walls (bottom-right card)\n- Photos must be cropped and scaled to fill most of their card area while maintaining padding to the white outline (no photo should touch the card border directly).\n- No animal photos or other extra shapes should remain on this slide. The final result should read as a clean, professional gallery of four images on a dark background with uniform framing.",
